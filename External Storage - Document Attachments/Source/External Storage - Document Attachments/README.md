## Usage

### Multi-Company and Multi-Environment Support

#### Environment Hash
Every file uploaded to external storage includes an environment hash that uniquely identifies:
- **Tenant ID**: Your Business Central tenant
- **Environment Name**: Current environment (e.g., Production, Sandbox)
- **Company System ID**: Unique identifier for the company

This ensures files from different tenants, environments, or companies are properly isolated in external storage.

#### Folder Structure
Files are organized hierarchically:
```
RootFolder/
  ├── [EnvironmentHash-1]/
  │   ├── Sales_Header/
  │   │   └── invoice-{guid}.pdf
  │   └── Purchase_Header/
  │       └── order-{guid}.pdf
  └── [EnvironmentHash-2]/
      └── Sales_Header/
          └── quote-{guid}.pdf
```

#### File Migration

1. Open **External Storage Setup** page
2. Click **Migrate Files** action
3. System automatically:
   - Identifies files from previous environment/company
   - Copies files to current environment/company folder structure
   - Updates file paths and environment hash
   - Maintains all file metadata and associations

#### Environment Hash Display
