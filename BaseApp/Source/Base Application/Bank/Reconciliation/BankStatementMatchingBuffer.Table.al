/// Temporary buffer table for storing and ranking potential matches during automatic bank reconciliation.
/// This table accumulates candidate ledger entries that could potentially match with bank statement lines,
/// along with scoring information, quality metrics, and matching criteria details. Used internally by
/// matching algorithms to evaluate, rank, and select the best matches based on configurable rules and
/// thresholds before applying final matching decisions.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Key features include match quality scoring, detailed criteria tracking (amounts, dates, document numbers),
/// one-to-many relationship handling, related party matching status, and comprehensive match details for
/// audit and review purposes. The buffer enables sophisticated ranking algorithms that consider multiple
/// matching factors simultaneously, supporting both exact and fuzzy matching scenarios with weighted scoring.
/// Used exclusively during matching processes and cleared after each matching operation completion.
