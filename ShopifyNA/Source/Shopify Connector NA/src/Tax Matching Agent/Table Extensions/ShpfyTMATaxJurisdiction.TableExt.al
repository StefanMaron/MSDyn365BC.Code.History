/// human verifies it: while it is Created by Agent and not yet Verified, a match to it is forced
/// to low confidence and held for review (unless the shop's review mode is Never, where nothing is
/// held), so the agent cannot silently trust master data it invented. Verified is set when a user
/// approves any order that uses the jurisdiction.
/// Jurisdictions created by a user/admin (or existing before this feature) keep Created by Agent =
/// false and are never quarantined, so no data migration is required.
