/// Page Shpfy TMA Order Tax Lines Part (ID 30479).
/// ListPart variant of the Shopify Order Tax Lines surface, embedded as a subform on the
/// Tax Match Review page (page 30471). The platform renders AI confidence indicators
/// on Activity Log-anchored fields when they appear on a Card or in a ListPart embedded
/// in a Card — so embedding this part is what makes per-tax-line agent indicators
/// visible. The Tax Jurisdiction Code is editable so a reviewer can correct or complete a
/// match, and each line shows Business Central's Tax Detail rate next to Shopify's rate with
/// the row highlighted green when they agree and red when they differ. The host page calls
/// SetTaxLineFilter to scope the part to a single order's tax lines (tax lines link to order
/// lines via Parent Id, so the host passes the order's order line ids).
