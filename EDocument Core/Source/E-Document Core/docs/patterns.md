# Patterns

This document covers the recurring code patterns used in E-Document Core and, just as importantly, the legacy patterns you should avoid. For the full processing flows, see [business-logic.md](business-logic.md). For extension contracts, see [extensibility.md](extensibility.md).

## Interface polymorphism via enum dispatch

The most pervasive pattern in the codebase. Rather than using abstract codeunits or event-based dispatch, the framework uses AL's enum-implements-interface feature as a strategy + factory pattern. An extensible enum value binds to a codeunit that implements the interface. Configuration stores the enum value; runtime reads it and dispatches.

This pattern appears in:

- `"E-Document Format"` (`enum 6101`) implements `"E-Document"` interface -- format serialization
- `"Service Integration"` (`enum 6151`) implements `IDocumentSender`, `IDocumentReceiver`, `IConsentManager` -- service communication
- `"Integration Action Type"` (`enum 6170`) implements `IDocumentAction` -- extensible actions
- `"E-Document Service Status"` (`enum 6106`) implements `IEDocumentStatus` -- status-dependent behavior
- `"Structure Received E-Doc."` (`enum 6103`) implements `IStructureReceivedEDocument` -- structuring raw data
- `"E-Doc. Read into Draft"` (`enum 6109`) implements `IStructuredFormatReader` -- parsing structured data
- `"E-Doc. Process Draft"` (`enum 6107`) implements `IProcessStructuredData` -- draft preparation, including purchase and sales draft types
- `"E-Document Type"` (`enum 6121`) implements `IEDocumentFinishDraft` -- document creation per type
- `"Export Eligibility Evaluator"` implements `IExportEligibilityEvaluator` -- export gating
- `"E-Doc. File Format"` implements `IEDocFileFormat`, `IBlobType` -- file type behavior
- `"E-Document Message Type"` implements `IEDocMessageBuilder` -- lifecycle message payload construction
- `"E-Document Format"` also implements `IEDocResponseProvider` -- lets a format request a related response message

The enum value is stored on the E-Document or Service table and read at the dispatch site. For example, in `ImportEDocumentProcess.ReadIntoDraft()`:

```al
IStructuredFormatReader := EDocument."Read into Draft Impl.";
EDocument."Process Draft Impl." := IStructuredFormatReader.ReadIntoDraft(EDocument, FromBlob);
```

This is clean but has a consequence: the dispatch decision is locked to a single field value. You cannot chain implementations or compose behaviors without building that into the interface contract.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- added sales draft and message dispatch enum patterns.*

## Error-trapping codeunit wrapper ("if codeunit.run")

Every call to an external interface implementation is wrapped in a dedicated codeunit that runs inside a `if not Codeunit.Run()` pattern. The framework commits before the call, runs the wrapper codeunit, and catches runtime errors. This isolates interface failures from the calling transaction.

Concrete wrappers include `EDocumentCreate.Codeunit.al` (for format `Create`), `SendRunner.Codeunit.al` (for `IDocumentSender.Send`), `ReceiveDocuments.Codeunit.al`, `DownloadDocument.Codeunit.al`, `MarkFetched.Codeunit.al`, and `EDocumentActionRunner.Codeunit.al`.

The pattern in `EDocIntegrationManagement.RunSend()`:

```al
Commit();
SendRunner.SetDocumentAndService(EDocument, EDocumentService);
SendRunner.SetContext(SendContext);
if not SendRunner.Run() then
    EDocumentErrorHelper.LogSimpleErrorMessage(EDocument, GetLastErrorText());
EDocument.Get(EDocument."Entry No");  // re-read after interface call
```

The `Commit()` before the call is essential -- without it, a runtime error in the interface implementation would roll back the E-Document record itself.

## Error accumulation (collecting parameter)

Rather than failing on the first error, the framework counts errors before and after an operation to determine success:

```al
ErrorCount := EDocumentErrorHelper.ErrorMessageCount(EDocument);
RunSend(EDocumentService, EDocument, SendContext, IsAsync);
Success := EDocumentErrorHelper.ErrorMessageCount(EDocument) = ErrorCount;
```

This pattern appears throughout `EDocExport`, `EDocIntegrationManagement`, and `ImportEDocumentProcess`. It allows interface implementations to log multiple error messages (via `EDocumentErrorHelper.LogSimpleErrorMessage`) and the framework to detect whether any new errors were added.

## Context objects for integration calls

Send and receive operations use context codeunits (`SendContext`, `ReceiveContext`, `ActionContext`) that bundle HTTP request/response, TempBlob, status, and metadata. This replaces the older pattern of passing `HttpRequestMessage` and `HttpResponseMessage` as separate parameters.

The context objects provide a fluent API: `SendContext.Http().GetHttpRequestMessage()`, `SendContext.Status().SetStatus()`, `SendContext.GetTempBlob()`. After the interface call, the framework reads the HTTP objects from the context to log them in the integration log.

## Manual event subscribers as stateful context carriers

The AI tool codeunits in `Processing/AI/Tools/` use a non-standard pattern: `EventSubscriberInstance = Manual` combined with instance variables to carry context across an execution lifecycle. This differs from the typical BC event subscriber pattern where subscribers are stateless singletons.

In this pattern, a codeunit declares `EventSubscriberInstance = Manual` and `TableNo = "E-Document Purchase Line"` (or similar). The orchestrator (`EDocAIToolProcessor`) binds the instance, then calls it with row-level context via `OnRun()`. Instance variables like `EDocumentNo: Integer` persist between method calls on the same instance, so the `Execute()` callback (invoked later by the AI function-calling loop) can access state that was set during initialization.

```al
codeunit 6177 "E-Doc. Historical Matching" implements "AOAI Function", IEDocAISystem
{
    EventSubscriberInstance = Manual;
    TableNo = "E-Document Purchase Line";

    var
        EDocumentNo: Integer;  // context set in OnRun, used in Execute

    trigger OnRun()
    begin
        EDocumentNo := Rec."E-Document Entry No.";  // capture context
        EDocumentAIProcessor.Setup(this);            // bind instance
        EDocumentAIProcessor.Process(...);           // AI loop calls Execute()
    end;

    procedure Execute(Arguments: JsonObject): Variant
    begin
        // EDocumentNo is available here from the OnRun context
    end;
}
```

This pattern appears in `EDocHistoricalMatching`, `EDocGLAccountMatching`, `EDocDeferralMatching`, and `EDocSimilarDescriptions`. The key advantage is that state flows through the instance rather than through event parameters, keeping the AI tool interface clean while preserving row-level context across asynchronous function calls. The older Purchase Order Matching Copilot action and buffer/page objects are pending obsolete; current AI-assisted matching runs during import-time draft preparation through `E-Doc. AI Tool Processor` and the matching tool codeunits.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- noted the obsolete PO matching Copilot path and current import-time AI matching.*

## Data Exchange bridge into staging tables

The Data Exchange V2 purchase reader uses a bridge pattern. It lets the platform Data Exchange pipeline parse XML into `Intermediate Data Import`, then maps that intermediate data into `E-Document Purchase Header` and `E-Document Purchase Line` staging records. This keeps Data Exchange definitions declarative while still fitting the V2 import pipeline's draft, prepare, and finish stages.

The bridge also performs work that Data Exchange mappings cannot express cleanly: choosing the configured definition by root namespace, applying the blank-LCY currency convention, decoding embedded attachments, and adding PEPPOL allowance charge lines to intermediate data before staging line creation.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- documented the Data Exchange V2 bridge pattern.*

## Bidirectional state machine (import pipeline)

The V2.0 import pipeline in `ImportEDocumentProcess.Codeunit.al` is a bidirectional state machine. Given a current status and a desired status, `GetEDocumentToDesiredStatus()` calculates the path:

1. If going backward: undo steps from current down to desired + 1
2. If going forward: run steps from current up to desired - 1

The `StatusStepIndex()` function maps each `"Import E-Doc. Proc. Status"` to a numeric index (0-4), and `GetNextStep()` / `GetPreviousStep()` map statuses to the `"Import E-Document Steps"` enum values that transition between them.

This design makes it possible to revert a processed document back to any earlier stage. For example, if a user notices the vendor was resolved incorrectly, they can revert from "Draft Ready" to "Ready for draft", change vendor data, and re-run "Prepare draft". The same state machine now routes to different draft types: purchase invoices and credit memos use purchase staging, while inbound orders use sales staging and Sales Order creation.

## Workflow as orchestration layer

The framework delegates flow control to BC's Workflow engine rather than hardcoding the sequence of operations. The E-Document workflow setup (`EDocumentWorkFlowSetup.Codeunit.al`) registers workflow events and responses. The key events are "E-Document Created" and "E-Document Sent". Responses include "Send E-Document to Service", "Send E-Document via Email".

This means the sequence of operations (export -> send -> email -> approval) is configured in the workflow, not in code. `EDocumentCreatedFlow.Codeunit.al` triggers the workflow after document creation, and each workflow step response delegates to the appropriate framework method.

## Lifecycle messages as related payloads

Some PEPPOL interactions are not new BC documents. Core models them as `E-Document Message` records linked to the parent E-Document, with payloads stored in `E-Doc. Data Storage`. The message type enum dispatches to a builder, while the document format can opt in by implementing `IEDocResponseProvider`.

This keeps order responses out of the document creation pipeline while preserving an auditable payload and response status on the E-Document. Inbound `OrderResponse` XML is stored against the matching outbound E-Document and the temporary inbound carrier is deleted.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- added lifecycle message pattern for order responses.*

## Blob management (TempBlob and Data Storage)

Blobs flow through the system in two forms: in-memory `TempBlob` codeunits during processing, and persisted `"E-Doc. Data Storage"` records for permanent storage. The conversion happens in `EDocumentLog.InsertLog()`, which writes the TempBlob to a new Data Storage record and links it via `"E-Doc. Data Storage Entry No."` on the log entry.

Inbound documents can accumulate multiple blobs: the original unstructured content, the structured conversion, and document attachments. The E-Document tracks two primary references: `"Unstructured Data Entry No."` and `"Structured Data Entry No."`.

## RecordRef-based generic processing

Export operations work with RecordRef rather than specific table types, enabling a single code path for Sales, Purchase, Service, and other document types. `PopulateEDocument()` in `EDocExport.Codeunit.al` uses `SourceDocumentHeader.Number` to determine the table and then reads fields via `SourceDocumentHeader.Field(FieldNo).Value`. The mapping engine (`EDocMapping.Codeunit.al`) also operates on RecordRefs.

The downside is that field access is by field number, making the code harder to follow and susceptible to breaking if field numbers change.

## IEDocumentStatus: behavior per enum value

The `"E-Document Service Status"` enum uniquely implements `IEDocumentStatus`. Each enum value declares which of three status codeunits handles it:

- Values like `Created`, `Imported`, `Pending Response` use the `DefaultImplementation = "E-Doc In Progress Status"` (they represent in-progress states)
- Values like `Exported`, `Sent`, `Approved`, `Cleared` explicitly set `Implementation = IEDocumentStatus = "E-Doc Processed Status"`
- Error values like `Sending Error`, `Export Error` set `Implementation = IEDocumentStatus = "E-Doc Error Status"`

This lets `EDocumentProcessing.ModifyEDocumentStatus()` call the service status enum value's interface to determine the overall E-Document status without a giant case statement.

## Legacy patterns

These patterns exist in the codebase but are deprecated. Understanding them helps when reading code inside `#if not CLEAN26` or `#if not CLEAN27` blocks.

### V1.0 import process

**What**: The original single-stage import where the format interface's `GetBasicInfoFromReceivedDocument()` and `GetCompleteInfoFromReceivedDocument()` methods directly create BC purchase documents in one shot.

**Where**: `EDocImport.V1_ProcessEDocument()`, `EDocImport.V1_BeforeInsertImportedEdocument()`, and the `"E-Document"` interface methods `GetBasicInfoFromReceivedDocument` / `GetCompleteInfoFromReceivedDocument`.

**Why deprecated**: No staging tables, no user review, no reversibility. Format implementations had to know how to create Purchase Invoices, violating separation of concerns.

**What to do instead**: Use V2.0 pipeline with `"Import Process" = "Version 2.0"`, which is the default for new services. Implement `IStructuredFormatReader` to populate staging tables and let the framework handle BC document creation.

### Old "E-Document Integration" enum and interface

**What**: The original `"E-Document Integration"` enum (`enum 6132`) and its `"E-Document Integration"` interface, which combined send, receive, and action methods into a single interface. Methods took raw `HttpRequestMessage`/`HttpResponseMessage` parameters.

**Where**: `EDocumentIntegration.Interface.al`, `EDocumentIntegration.Enum.al`, and the `"Service Integration"` field (field 4) on `"E-Document Service"`.

**Why deprecated**: Too coarse-grained (one interface for all operations), raw HTTP parameters instead of context objects, no support for the V2.0 receive flow.

**What to do instead**: Extend `"Service Integration"` (`enum 6151`) and implement the granular interfaces: `IDocumentSender`, `IDocumentReceiver`, `IDocumentResponseHandler`, `ISentDocumentActions`, `IReceivedDocumentMarker`.

### GetDocumentCountInBatch()

**What**: V1.0 receive flow called `EDocIntegration.GetDocumentCountInBatch()` to determine how many documents were in a received blob, then called `ReceiveDocument()` to get the blob.

**Where**: `EDocIntegrationManagement.ReceiveDocument()` (inside `#if not CLEAN26`).

**Why deprecated**: Awkward two-step receive pattern that bundled all documents in a single blob. V2.0 uses `ReceiveDocuments()` which returns a `"Temp Blob List"` with one entry per document, and `DownloadDocument()` fetches each individually.

### Manual GetIntegrationSetup()

**What**: Connector apps had to implement a method that returned a setup page ID, called by the service card to open integration-specific settings.

**Why deprecated**: Replaced by the `OnBeforeOpenServiceIntegrationSetupPage` event pattern, which is more flexible and doesn't require interface changes.

### IPurchaseLineAccountProvider

**What**: Earlier interface for determining purchase line account type and number during import.

**Where**: `Processing/Interfaces/IPurchaseLineAccountProvider.Interface.al` (marked `ObsoleteState = Pending`, tag `27.0`).

**Why deprecated**: Too narrow -- only sets account type and number. Replaced by `IPurchaseLineProvider`, which operates on the full `"E-Document Purchase Line"` record and can set any field.

### CLEANSCHEMA and CLEAN version markers

The codebase uses compiler directives to manage deprecation:

- `#if not CLEAN26` -- code to be removed when BC version 26 cleanup happens
- `#if not CLEAN27` -- code to be removed when BC version 27 cleanup happens
- `#if not CLEANSCHEMA26` / `#if not CLEANSCHEMA29` -- table schema changes (field removals) that need separate cleanup due to schema migration constraints

When reading the code, content inside these blocks is legacy. The code outside (or in the `#else` branch) is the current implementation.

## Notification state vs. display

Purchase Document Draft notifications are split across two codeunits so that a
call site tells you whether UI is raised.

`"E-Doc. Draft Notif. State"` (6436) owns the `E-Document Notification` rows, the
Sub Total mismatch calculation, and its telemetry. It never constructs or sends a
`Notification` and knows nothing about `My Notifications`.

`"E-Document Notification"` (6123) is the only codeunit consumers call. It gates on
`My Notifications`, delegates state changes downward, builds `Notification` objects,
and hosts the `Dismiss…`/`Disable…` action handlers. The dependency is one-way.

The procedure verb is the contract:

| Prefix | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| `Add…` / `Refresh…` / `Remove…` / `ReArm…` | State only, never displays |
| `Show…` / `RefreshAndShow…` | Displays a notification |
| `Is…` | Query, no side effects |

Handler names passed to `Notification.AddAction` are resolved by string at runtime,
so `DismissSubTotalMismatchNotification` and friends cannot be renamed safely.

*Updated: 2026-08-05 -- documented the notification state vs. display split.*
