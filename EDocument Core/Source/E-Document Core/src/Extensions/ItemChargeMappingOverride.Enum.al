/// The enum is extensible, but the built-in classification only resolves the members declared here.
/// An extension that adds a member is responsible for turning it into a structure: subscribe to

/// read the value from the "Item Charge" the "No." of the charge line the event passes points at, and set
/// the Structure parameter accordingly. Both events are raised last, so the structure a subscriber sets wins
