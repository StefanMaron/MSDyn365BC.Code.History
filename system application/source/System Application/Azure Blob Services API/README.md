    begin
        Authorization := StorageServiceAuthorization.CreateSharedKey('<my shared key>');

        ABSContainerClient.Initialize('<storage account name>', Authorization);
        ABSContainerClient.CreateContainer('<my fist container>');

        ABSBlobClient.Initialize('<storage account name>', '<my fist container>', Authorization);
        ABSBlobClient.PutBlobBlockBlobText('<my first blob>', 'Yay! This is my first BLOB in Azure Blob Storage services!')
