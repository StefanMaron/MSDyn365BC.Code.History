**Note** 
Azure Active Directory Graph is being retired, and we recommend that you start using Microsoft Graph instead. To avoid causing issues with apps that use the Azure AD Graph module in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], we haven't changed its name or the names of the objects it contains. For more information about the Azure Active Directory Graph retirement, see [Migrate Azure AD Graph apps to Microsoft Graph](/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview).
