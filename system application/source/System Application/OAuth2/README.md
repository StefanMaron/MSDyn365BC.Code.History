This module contains tools that support authentication through Microsoft Entra ID using OAuth 2.0 authorization protocols.

To learn more about the Microsoft Identity Platform, see [Microsoft Identity Platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/).

Use this module to do the following:
- Acquire a token by using the authorization code grant flow. For more information, see [Authorize access to Microsoft Entra ID web applications using the OAuth 2.0 code grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-protocols-oauth-code/) for v1.0 or [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow/) for v2.0.<br />
- Acquire a token by using the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow. For more information, see [Service-to-service calls that use delegated user identity in the On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow/) for v1.0 or [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) for v2.0.<br />
- Ask for directory admin consent for all the defined application permissions, see [Admin consent on the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-admin-consent)
- Acquire a token by using the client credentials grant flow. This requires that the administrator user has already consented the required application permissions. For more information, see [Service to service calls using client credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow/) for v1.0 or [Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) for v2.0. To learn more about admin-restricted permissions, see [Admin-restricted permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#admin-restricted-permissions/).<br />
- Acquire the authorization code token from cache or a new refreshed token if the existing one has expired. This requires that the token was obtained earlier through the authorization code flow. This returns either the current token from cache or will try to refresh it in the background and return a new access token.<br />
- Acquire the access and refresh tokens by using the OBO flow. For more information, see [Service-to-service calls that use delegated user identity in the On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow/) for v1.0 or [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) for v2.0.<br />.<br />
- Acquire the OBO token from cache or a new refreshed token if the existing one has expired. This requires that the token was obtained earlier through the OBO flow. This returns either the current token from cache or will try to refresh it in the background and return a new access token.<br />
- Retrieve Business Central default Redirect URL.<br />
