This module provides methods for retrieving and managing user plans in Microsoft Entra as well as configuring the permissions users will get when assigned a plan. The Plan and User Plan tables are marked as internal, so you must use the methods provided in this module to query them.

For on-premises versions, you can also use this module to do the following:
- Check which plans are assigned to the users.
- Update user plans.
- Check for mixed plans.
- Query the internal Plan and User Plan tables.
