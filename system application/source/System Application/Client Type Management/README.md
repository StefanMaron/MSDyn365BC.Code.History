This module is to allow testing of functionality that relies on a client type other than the one that the test is executed on.

Use this module to do the following:

- Get the client type of the user.

To see how to mock the client type in tests, see `SetClientType` in [codeunit "Test Client Type Subscriber"](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/blob/master/Modules/System%20Test%20Libraries/Client%20Type%20Management/src/TestClientTypeSubscriber.Codeunit.al).
