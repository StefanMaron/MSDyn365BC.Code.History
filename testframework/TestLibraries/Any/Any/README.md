This module provides functionality for generating pseudorandom values during test set-up.

Use this module to do the following:
- Generate values in the test setup.
- Make the test code easier to read.
- Get better coverage by changing the values generated by calling the SetSeed method.

Additional Notes:
This module always generates values in the same order, unless the SetSeed method is called.
This helps with reproducing the test failures.

Tests should always use the pseudorandom values, unless the parameter must be set to a specific value.
In that case, document the reason for hard-coding the value.

This module must not be used outside the test code.
