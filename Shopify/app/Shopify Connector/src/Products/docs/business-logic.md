# Products business logic

Two primary flows: Export (BC to Shopify) and Import (Shopify to BC).

## Export flow

`ShpfyProductExport` is the entry point. It filters for products that have an
`Item SystemId` (i.e., already linked to a BC Item), then calls
`UpdateProductData` for each.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Load ShpfyProduct + BC Item] --> B{Item blocked?}
    B -- yes --> C{Shop removal policy?}
    C -- StatusToArchived --> D[Skip if already archived]
    C -- StatusToDraft --> E[Skip if already draft]
    C -- DoNothing --> F[Skip entirely]
    B -- no --> G[FillInProductFields from Item]
    G --> H{Record changed?}
    H -- no --> I[Skip API call]
    H -- yes --> J[ProductApi.UpdateProduct]
    J --> K[Loop existing variants]
    K --> L[Match to ItemVariant + UoM]
    L --> M[UpdateProductVariant]
    K --> N[Loop BC ItemVariants not in Shopify]
    N --> O[CreateProductVariant]
```

Change detection in `UpdateProductData` works by snapshotting the product record
before filling fields, then comparing every field via RecordRef. Only when at
least one field differs does it call the API. This avoids burning API quota on
unchanged products.

Variant handling branches on two axes: whether the item has variants, and whether
`UoM as Variant` is enabled. With UoM-as-variant, the connector searches all three
option slots to find the matching UoM value before deciding create-vs-update. The
logic in `UpdateProductData` is intentionally exhaustive -- it checks Option 1,
then Option 2, then Option 3 for the UoM match.

Existing Shopify variants may map to child Items, not only to the parent Item
behind the Shopify Product. After updating those existing variants,
`UpdateProductData` re-fetches the parent Item by the product's `Item SystemId`
before it scans BC Item Variants to create missing Shopify variants. Without that
reset, the second half of export can accidentally continue with the last child
Item loaded from the variant loop.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- child-item variant handling now resets to the parent item before creating missing variants*

Price-only mode (`OnlyUpdatePrice`) skips all non-price fields and attempts a bulk
GraphQL mutation through `ShpfyBulkOperationMgt`. The bulk decision uses the
number of changed variant prices queued in `GraphQueryList`, not the total number
of variants considered. If bulk cannot be sent, the connector falls back to
per-variant API calls and reverts any failed variants from the request snapshot.
When bulk is sent, request data is stored for rollback and, when all logging is
enabled, the sent JSONL can be downloaded from Shopify Bulk Operations.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Calculate variant prices] --> B{Any price, compare-at, or cost changed?}
    B -- no --> C[Do not queue variant]
    B -- yes --> D[Queue GraphQL call and JSONL row]
    D --> E{Changed count >= bulk threshold?}
    E -- yes --> F[Try SendBulkMutation]
    F -- accepted --> G[Webhook completes and failed lines are reverted or logged]
    F -- not accepted --> H[Send queued variants individually]
    E -- no --> H
    H --> I[Revert individual failures]
```

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- bulk price threshold is based on changed prices and JSONL diagnostics are retained*

### Product creation

When exporting a BC Item that has no Shopify product yet, `ShpfyCreateProduct`
handles initial creation. It builds temp Product and Variant records,
fills prices via `ShpfyProductPriceCalc`, resolves the initial status through
`ICreateProductStatusValue`, and calls `ProductApi.CreateProduct`. Blocked or
sales-blocked item variants are skipped with a logged reason. The 2048-variant
Shopify limit is enforced upfront -- if the expected variant count exceeds it,
the entire item is skipped.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Read Shop Status for Created Products] --> B{Selected value}
    B -- Active --> C[Set Product.Status = Active]
    B -- Draft --> D[Set Product.Status = Draft]
    B -- Unlisted --> E[Set Product.Status = Unlisted]
    C --> F[Create Shopify product]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

Unlisted is a creation status only when the shop setting chooses it. The
connector sets the product enum value and sends it through the normal create
payload; it does not add special local branching for Unlisted. Existing product
removal still uses the separate "Action for Removed Products" interface, where
blocked items can be archived, drafted, or left unchanged.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- product creation can now choose Unlisted status*

### Price calculation

`ShpfyProductPriceCalc` creates a temporary Sales Quote header using the Shop's
posting groups, VAT settings, customer price group, and currency. It then inserts
a temporary Sales Line for the item/variant/UoM combination and reads the
calculated `Unit Price`, `Line Amount`, and `Unit Cost`. If ComparePrice is less
than or equal to Price after calculation, ComparePrice is zeroed out. Events fire
before and after to allow overrides.

Because the codeunit is SingleInstance, the temporary Sales Quote is cached across
calls. `SetShop` now also compares the cached quote's document date with
`WorkDate()` before reusing it. This matters for unattended Sync Prices sessions:
without that check, a long-lived session could keep calculating against an old
document date after WorkDate changed.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- price calculation cache is refreshed when WorkDate changes*

Before any price calculation, `CalcPrice` validates the unit of measure via
`IsValidUoM`. This checks that the UoM code exists in the `Unit of Measure`
table and is a valid `Item Unit of Measure` for the given item. If validation
fails, the entire price sync for that item/variant/UoM combination is skipped
and a `Shpfy Skipped Record` entry is logged with a descriptive message
("Item price is not synchronized because the unit of measure %1 is not valid for
item %2"). This prevents errors when an item's Sales Unit of Measure has been
deleted or is otherwise misconfigured.

*Updated: 2026-04-08 -- CalcPrice now validates UoM before calculating and skips invalid combinations (PR #7498)*

### Image sync

`ShpfySyncProductImage` supports both directions. Export iterates products,
computes the image hash, and pushes changed images via bulk mutation. Import
downloads images by URL and writes them to the BC Item's Picture field. Variant
images are handled separately -- they update Item Variant pictures when the
variant maps to an Item Variant, or the Item picture when it maps to the Item
itself.

### Body html generation

`CreateProductBody` in `ShpfyProductExport` assembles the Shopify product
description from three optional sources: extended text lines, marketing text
(Entity Text), and item attributes rendered as an HTML table. Each source is
controlled by a Shop toggle. The result is wrapped in styled divs.

## Import flow

`ShpfyProductImport` processes one product at a time. For each variant it calls
`ShpfyProductMapping.FindMapping` to resolve a BC Item.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[For each variant] --> B{FindMapping?}
    B -- found --> C{Shopify Can Update Items?}
    C -- yes --> D[ShpfyUpdateItem]
    C -- no --> E[Skip]
    B -- not found --> F{Auto Create Unknown Items?}
    F -- yes --> G[ShpfyCreateItem.Run per unmapped variant]
    F -- no --> H[Log error on product]
```

Mapping in `ShpfyProductMapping.DoFindMapping` is SKU-strategy-driven. Based on
the Shop's SKU Mapping setting, it tries to match the variant's SKU to an Item
No., Vendor Item No., Variant Code, Item No.+Variant Code (split by separator),
or Barcode. If the primary strategy fails, barcode matching runs only when the
Shop's `Find Mapping by Barcode` setting is enabled. The `OnBeforeFindProductMapping`
event fires before any of this, allowing complete override.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start mapping] --> B[Run OnBeforeFindProductMapping]
    B --> C{Handled?}
    C -- yes --> D[Use subscriber result]
    C -- no --> E[Try selected SKU mapping]
    E --> F{Found?}
    F -- yes --> G[Write Item and Item Variant links]
    F -- no --> H{Find Mapping by Barcode?}
    H -- yes --> I[Try variant barcode lookup]
    H -- no --> J[Remain unmapped]
    I --> K{Found by barcode?}
    K -- yes --> G
    K -- no --> J
```

Disable the fallback when barcodes are not unique enough to be an identity key.
The SKU strategy still runs first, so the setting only controls the last-chance
barcode lookup.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- barcode fallback is now controlled by a shop setting*

Item creation in `ShpfyCreateItem` applies an Item Template (from Shop config or
event override), sets description, prices (converted from shop currency if
needed), vendor, and item category. For `Item No. + Variant Code` and `Variant
Code` SKU mappings, it also creates Item Variants and cross-references
(barcodes, vendor item references).

When `"Sync HS Code and Country"` (captioned *Sync HS Code and Country of Origin*) is enabled, new Items copy the variant's
HS code and country from Shopify. Existing Items are updated only when the
Shopify value resolves to an existing BC Tariff Number or Country/Region, so an
unknown or blank Shopify value does not clear a valid BC value.

Product import first compares Shopify product IDs and timestamps. A product is
retrieved only when Shopify's `Updated At` is newer than both the local product
`Updated At` and `Last Updated by BC`, or when the product is new locally. If a
product is skipped as stale, the importer never enters the variant retrieval path
that deletes records for variants missing in Shopify. This preserves mapped
variants when only the timestamp comparison is stale.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- HS code/country import and stale-product variant preservation documented*
