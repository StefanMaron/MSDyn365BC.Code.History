# Companies

B2B company management -- separate from D2C customer sync.

## What it does

Imports Shopify companies and maps them to BC Customers. B2B features
(companies, catalogs) are now available on all Shopify plans, not just Plus.

*Updated: 2026-04-08 -- B2B features no longer restricted to Shopify Plus*
Each company has locations with billing addresses, tax registration IDs, and
payment terms. The company's main contact is a Shopify Customer used for email
and phone-based matching.

## How it works

`ShpfyCompanyImport` retrieves the company and its main contact from the API,
updates locations, then delegates to `ShpfyCompanyMapping.FindMapping`. The
mapping resolves through the `ICompanyMapping` interface, selected by the Shop's
"Company Mapping Type" enum. If no match is found and auto-create is on,
`ShpfyCreateCustomer.CreateCustomerFromCompany` builds a BC Customer from the
company's location data (address, phone, tax ID, payment terms).

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- company export now resolves ISO country codes before
tax-area lookup, and tax ID mapping is explicitly localization-friendly*

## Things to know

- B2B features (companies, catalogs) are available on all Shopify plans.
  The old Shopify Plus restriction has been removed.
- The relationship chain is Company -> Location -> Customer. A company has
  locations (physical addresses), and each company has a main contact who is a
  Shopify Customer record. The `Main Contact Customer Id` on the Company
  links to `Shpfy Customer`.
- `Customer SystemId` on Company links to the BC Customer, same pattern as
  Customers and Products.
- `ShpfyCompanyExport` now includes a `Shop Code` filter when checking for
  an existing company by External Id. Previously, a company exported from
  shop A could falsely block export from shop B.
  *Updated: 2026-04-08 -- Shop Code filter added to company export lookup*
- Company Locations can override the default customer mapping for order
  processing via `Sell-to Customer No.` and `Bill-to Customer No.` fields.
- Three mapping strategies exist: By Email/Phone (matches main contact's
  email/phone to BC Customer), By Tax Id (matches location's tax registration
  ID to BC Customer via the `Tax Registration Id Mapping` interface), and
  Default Company (always returns a configured default).
- `IFindCompanyMapping` extends `ICompanyMapping` with a `FindMapping` method.
  The mapping codeunit checks at runtime whether the selected implementation
  supports `IFindCompanyMapping` and falls back to `CompByEmailPhone` if not.
- Tax registration ID mapping is itself pluggable via
  `Shpfy Tax Registration Id Mapping` interface. The base app includes
  `ShpfyTaxRegistrationNo` (matches Registration Number) and
  `ShpfyVATRegistrationNo` (matches VAT Registration No.); localizations can
  add enum values that map the Shopify tax ID to a country-specific customer
  field, such as the Belgian Enterprise No.
- Company export resolves the BC Country/Region to its ISO code before setting
  `Shpfy Company Location`.`Country/Region Code` and before filtering
  `Shpfy Tax Area`. This matters for countries where the BC code differs from
  Shopify's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
- When creating customers from companies, the county is resolved through the
  same `ICounty` interface used by the Customers module.
