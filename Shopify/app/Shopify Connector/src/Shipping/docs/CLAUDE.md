# Shipping

Maps BC sales shipments to Shopify fulfillments and syncs shipping method configuration between the two systems. This is the outbound side of shipping -- when BC posts a sales shipment, this module creates the corresponding Shopify fulfillment via GraphQL.

## How it works

The `Shpfy Sync Shipm. to Shopify` report drives the process. It finds unsynced Sales Shipment Headers (those with a Shopify Order Id but no Fulfillment Id), fetches the fulfillment orders from Shopify, then calls `ShpfyExportShipments` to build and send `fulfillmentCreate` GraphQL mutations. The mutation is batched by location -- each Shopify location gets its own fulfillment request, with a hard cap of 250 line items per request.

Tracking information is assembled from the BC Shipping Agent record. The `Shpfy Tracking Company` enum on the Shipping Agent table extension maps BC agents to Shopify-recognized carriers. If the agent has an Internet Address, the tracking URL is resolved from it; otherwise, subscribers can override via `OnBeforeRetrieveTrackingUrl`. The `ShpfyShipmentMethodMapping` table maps Shopify delivery method names to BC Shipment Method Codes, Shipping Agents, and shipping charge G/L accounts or items.

Shipping charges are imported on the order side by `ShpfyShippingCharges`, which pulls `shippingLines` from the order and populates `Shpfy Order Shipping Charges`. Each shipping line's `taxLines` are stored in `Shpfy Order Tax Line` with the shipping line id as `Parent Id`, separate from order-level and item-line tax lines. This keeps freight tax attached to the shipping charge that becomes the BC freight sales line, so VAT on freight can be inspected with the charge instead of being flattened into order or item taxes. Any new shipping method title seen during import is auto-created as an unmapped entry in the mapping table.

Shipping method discovery now branches by Shopify shop features. Shops with `marketDrivenShipping` still create `Shpfy Shipment Method Mapping` records, but `ShpfyShippingMethods` reads active option definitions from Markets instead of legacy delivery profiles. The market query reads 25 markets at a time, stores the last market cursor in the `After` parameter, then switches from `Shipping_GetMarketShippingMethods` to `Shipping_GetNextMarketShippingMethods` until `data.markets.pageInfo.hasNextPage` is false.

## Things to know

- Fulfillments are grouped by Shopify Location Id. If an order spans multiple locations, multiple `fulfillmentCreate` mutations are sent.
- The module auto-accepts pending fulfillment requests for orders assigned to BC's fulfillment service before creating the fulfillment.
- Fulfillment orders from third-party fulfillment services (not BC's own) are skipped -- they cannot be fulfilled by BC.
- The `Shpfy Tracking Company` enum on Shipping Agent controls whether Shopify gets a recognized carrier name or the free-text agent name.
- A Fulfillment Id of -1 on the Sales Shipment Header means the export failed; -2 means no applicable lines.
- `ShpfyShippingEvents` exposes two integration events: `OnBeforeRetrieveTrackingUrl` and `OnGetNotifyCustomer` for extensibility.
- Shipping charge tax lines reuse `Shpfy Order Tax Line`. The parent can be an order id, an order line id, or a shipping line id; the tax line table resolves the order currency through whichever parent record exists.
- Market-driven shipping skips disabled markets, inherited shipping configurations, and carrier-calculated options without a static name. Only active named options become shipment method mapping rows.
