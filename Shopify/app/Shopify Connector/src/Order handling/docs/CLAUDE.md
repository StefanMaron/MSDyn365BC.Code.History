# Order handling

Imports Shopify orders into Business Central, maps them to customers and items, and creates sales orders or invoices.

## How it works

The pipeline has three stages.

- **Discovery**: `ShpfyOrdersAPI` queries the Shopify GraphQL API for orders updated since the last sync. `ShpfySyncOrdersfromShopify` refreshes the cached shop settings before this call, so plan-dependent query fields use the current Shopify plan. It writes lightweight rows into the `Orders to Import` queue table, not full order data. The query distinguishes first-time sync (open orders only) from incremental sync (all orders by updated-at).

- **Import**: `ShpfyImportOrder` fetches the full order JSON for each queued entry, populates `Order Header` and `Order Line` records, and pulls in related data (tax lines, attributes, risks, shipping charges, transactions, fulfillment orders, returns, refunds). Order line GraphQL pages now request 10 line items per call. If refund import is enabled and the Shopify order has returns, it queries `returns.exchangeLineItems` and marks matching `Order Line` records with `Is Exchange Item`. It detects conflicts when a previously processed order is edited in Shopify and flags them with `Has Order State Error`. Staff member retrieval in the GraphQL query and salesperson assignment during header population are conditional on `Shop."Advanced Shopify Plan"` (requires Plus/Advanced plans).

- **Processing**: `ShpfyProcessOrder` runs mapping then document creation. `ShpfyOrderMapping.DoMapping` resolves Shopify customers to BC customer numbers (with B2B company mapping as a separate path) and maps each order line's variant to an item/variant/UoM. `ShpfyProcessOrder.CreateHeaderFromShopifyOrder` builds a Sales Header with all three address contexts (sell-to, ship-to, bill-to), then `CreateLinesFromShopifyOrder` adds non-exchange item lines, tip lines (G/L), gift card lines (G/L), shipping charge lines, and a cash rounding line. Global discounts that were not allocated to individual lines are applied as invoice discount. If the shop has "Auto Release Sales Orders" enabled, the document is released immediately.

## Things to know

- Every monetary field exists in two flavours: shop currency (`Currency Code`) and presentment currency (`Presentment Currency Code`). Which one flows to the sales document depends on the shop's `Currency Handling` setting.
- `Orders to Import` is a queue, not a mirror. It is populated during discovery and consumed during import. It carries summary data and error tracking (`Has Error`, blob `Error Message` and `Error Call Stack`).
- The `Processed` flag on `Order Header` prevents re-processing. `IsProcessed()` also checks `Doc. Link To Doc.` so that orders linked to BC documents through any path are considered processed.
- `Document Date` has a validation trigger that calls `TestField("Sales Order No.", '')`, which prevents changes after a sales order has been created.
- The Shopify Order page (`ShpfyOrder.Page.al`) exposes contact lookup fields (`Sell-to Contact No.`, `Ship-to Contact No.`, `Bill-to Contact No.`) with `OnLookup` triggers that call `LookupContactForCustomer` to filter contacts by the related customer's company contact. The `OnValidate` triggers on these fields call `CheckContactRelatedToCustomer` to ensure the selected contact belongs to the correct customer. These fields are hidden by default (`Visible = false`).

- B2C mapping no longer overwrites a manually assigned `Sell-to Customer No.` just because bill-to mapping runs. If bill-to mapping cannot find a customer and no shop default customer is available, the existing sell-to customer is copied to bill-to so the order can still map.
- When customer mapping by email or phone is allowed to create an unknown BC customer, a Shopify customer with no default address can still be created from the first available Shopify customer address. If the Shopify customer has no addresses at all, mapping still returns blank.
- `SetAndInsertOrderLines` calls `TempOrderLine.Init()` for each GraphQL line item. Without that reset, a previous tip line could leave the temporary record's `Tip` flag set for the next line.
- Order tax lines can now belong to shipping charges as well as headers and item lines. The shared `Parent Id` points to the Shopify shipping line id for shipping-level taxes.
- `Created At`, `Updated At`, `Closed At`, and `Processed At` on the order header are Shopify timestamps. `Document Date` is the BC document date and is initialized from Shopify `createdAt` during import.
- Fulfilled orders become invoices instead of sales orders when `Create Invoices From Orders` is enabled on the shop.
- `ShpfyProcessOrders` (plural) is the batch entry point. After processing orders it also processes refunds if the shop uses the "Auto Create Credit Memo" strategy.
- `ShpfyOrders` (public API codeunit) exposes `MarkAsPaid` and `CancelOrder` for external callers.
