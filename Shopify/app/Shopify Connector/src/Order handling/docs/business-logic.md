*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- plan refresh and exchange-item filtering were added to the order pipeline*

## Phase 1: order discovery

`ShpfyOrdersAPI.GetOrdersToImport` paginates through Shopify's GraphQL `orders` connection. On first sync (no prior sync time), it uses `GetOpenOrdersToImport` which returns only open orders. On subsequent syncs it uses `GetOrdersToImport` filtered by `updatedAt` since the last sync time. For each order node it populates or updates a row in `Orders to Import`, computing the `Import Action` (New or Update) by checking whether an `Order Header` already exists. Closed orders are only imported as updates, never as new.

`ShpfySyncOrdersfromShopify` refreshes the cached shop settings with `Shop.GetShopSettings()` before it calls `GetOrdersToImport`. That matters for plan-gated order fields, because the import query later decides whether to request `staffMember` from the refreshed `Advanced Shopify Plan` value.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- order sync refreshes cached Shopify plan data before discovery*

## Phase 2: order import

`ShpfyImportOrder.ImportOrderAndCreateOrUpdate` does the heavy lifting. It fetches the full order JSON via a second GraphQL call (`GetOrderHeader`), retrieves order lines in a paginated loop (`GetOrderLines` / `GetNextOrderLines`), and populates the staging tables. The order line resource files request `lineItems(first: 10)`, so most orders need fewer GraphQL calls than the previous three-line page size. `SetAndInsertOrderLines` initializes the temporary order line record before every line item; this prevents flags such as `Tip` from carrying over from the previous JSON node.

`RetrieveOrderHeaderJson` conditionally includes the `staffMember { id }` field in the GraphQL query parameters based on `Shop."Advanced Shopify Plan"`. When the shop is not on an Advanced/Plus plan, the `StaffMember` parameter is sent as an empty string, omitting staff data from the query. `SetNewOrderHeaderValuesFromJson` (which populates the order header from the JSON response) similarly gates the staff member processing -- it only extracts the staff member ID and calls `SetSalespersonOnOrderHeader` when `Shop."Advanced Shopify Plan"` is true.

*Updated: 2026-04-08 -- staff member handling gated by Advanced Shopify Plan instead of B2B Enabled*

For already-processed orders, it runs conflict detection. A conflict is flagged if the current total items quantity increased, the line item composition changed (checked via a hash of line IDs), or the shipping charges amount changed. Conflicting orders get `Has Order State Error = true`.

After populating the header and lines, the import calls into related modules: fulfillment orders, shipping charges, transactions, returns (if the return/refund process requires import), and refunds. It then adjusts order line quantities and header amounts by subtracting refund line quantities and amounts. Zero-quantity lines are deleted. If the order is fully fulfilled and paid, and `Archive Processed Orders` is enabled, it closes the order in Shopify via the `CloseOrder` GraphQL mutation.

When refund import is enabled, `MarkExchangeItemOrderLines` runs after related records are imported and before refund quantities are considered. It skips the extra API call for orders whose return status is blank or `No Return`. For orders with returns, it pages through `returns(first: 10)` using `GetOrderExchangeLineItems` / `GetNextOrderExchangeLineItems`, collects the Shopify line item ids under each return's `exchangeLineItems`, and sets `Shpfy Order Line`.`Is Exchange Item` on matching order lines.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- order line pagination, temporary line reset, and exchange item marking changed import behavior*

## Phase 3: mapping and document creation

### Customer mapping

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A{B2B order?} -->|no| B[MapHeaderFields]
    A -->|yes| C[MapB2BHeaderFields]
    B --> D{Customer template exists for country?}
    D -->|yes, with default customer| E[Use default customer from template]
    D -->|no| F{Customer import = None?}
    F -->|yes| G[Use shop default customer]
    F -->|no| H{Sell-to customer already set?}
    H -->|no| I[Map or create sell-to from sell-to address]
    H -->|yes| I2[Keep existing sell-to]
    I --> K[Map bill-to from bill-to address]
    I2 --> K
    K --> L{Bill-to mapped?}
    L -->|yes| M[Use mapped bill-to]
    L -->|no, default exists| N[Use shop default customer]
    L -->|no default| O[Copy sell-to to bill-to]
    C --> B2BLoc{Company Location Id set?}
    B2BLoc -->|yes| P[MapSellToBillToCustomersFromCompanyLocation]
    B2BLoc -->|no| Q[CompanyMapping.DoMapping]
```

`ShpfyOrderMapping.DoMapping` first resolves the customer (or company for B2B), then iterates order lines. For B2C orders, `MapHeaderFields` maps sell-to only when `Sell-to Customer No.` is blank. It then maps bill-to from the bill-to address. If bill-to mapping returns blank and no default customer is configured, the existing sell-to customer is copied to bill-to. This preserves a manually assigned sell-to customer instead of replacing it during a failed bill-to mapping pass.

When the email/phone customer mapping strategy is allowed to create an unknown customer and the Shopify customer has no default address, the customer is created from the first available Shopify customer address. If the Shopify customer has no address records, mapping still fails with a blank customer number.

Tip lines require a configured `Tip Account`, gift card lines require a `Sold Gift Card Account`, and regular lines go through `MapVariant` which looks up the Shopify variant, auto-imports the product if needed, and resolves the BC item, variant code, and unit of measure.

The mapping also resolves shipping method (from `Shpfy Shipment Method Mapping` by shipping charge title), shipping agent, and payment method (from the order's successful transactions, only if a single payment method is found).

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- customer mapping now preserves existing sell-to values and handles Shopify customers without a default address*

### Sales document creation

`ShpfyProcessOrder.CreateHeaderFromShopifyOrder` inserts a Sales Header. The document type is Order by default, or Invoice if the order is already fulfilled and `Create Invoices From Orders` is enabled. It copies all three address blocks from the Shopify order, sets currency based on the shop's `Currency Handling`, applies the document date, shipping method, payment method, tax area, and payment terms. It writes a `Doc. Link To Doc.` record to tie the Shopify order to the BC document. If `Order Attributes To Shopify` is enabled, it pushes the BC document number back to Shopify as an order attribute.

`CreateLinesFromShopifyOrder` iterates order lines where `Is Exchange Item = false` and creates corresponding sales lines. Tips go to the tip G/L account, gift cards to the sold gift card G/L account, and regular items are validated with location code resolution from `Shpfy Shop Location`. Shipping charges become separate sales lines, either as G/L account lines using the shop's `Shipping Charges Account` or as item charge lines when configured through `Shpfy Shipment Method Mapping`. Item charges are automatically assigned to the item lines.

`ApplyGlobalDiscounts` calculates the portion of the order's total discount that was not allocated to individual lines or shipping charges, and applies it as an invoice discount on the sales header.

A final cash rounding line is created if the order has a non-zero `Payment Rounding Amount`, posted to the shop's `Cash Roundings Account`.

*Updated: 2026-07-29 -- exchange item order lines are skipped when creating the sales document*

## Error handling

`ShpfyProcessOrders.ProcessShopifyOrder` wraps `ShpfyProcessOrder.Run` in a `if not ... Run` pattern. On failure it captures the error text into the order header's `Error Message`, clears the sales document number, and calls `CleanUpLastCreatedDocument` to delete the partially created sales document. On success it sets `Processed = true` and records the `Processed Currency Handling` so refund processing later knows which currency was used.

## Contact lookup on the order page

The Shopify Order page exposes contact number fields for all three address contexts (sell-to, ship-to, bill-to). These fields are hidden by default and provide lookup and validation behavior.

- **Automatic resolution during mapping**: `ShpfyOrderMapping.FindContactNo` resolves a contact name to a contact number by finding a person-type contact whose name matches and whose company contact matches the customer's contact business relation. This runs during `DoMapping` for both standard and B2B paths, populating `Sell-to Contact No.`, `Ship-to Contact No.`, and `Bill-to Contact No.`.

- **Manual lookup on the page**: Each contact field's `OnLookup` trigger calls `OrderHeader.LookupContactForCustomer`, which filters the Contact list to contacts belonging to the customer's company contact. The user selects a contact, and `Validate` is called to store the selection.

- **Validation**: The `OnValidate` triggers on the contact number fields call `CheckContactRelatedToCustomer`, which verifies the selected contact is related to the corresponding customer via `Contact Business Relation`. If the contact is neither the company contact itself nor a person under that company, an error is raised.

- **Customer number changes**: When `Sell-to Customer No.` is validated on the order header, it automatically re-resolves `Sell-to Contact No.` and `Ship-to Contact No.` via `FindContactNo`. Similarly, validating `Bill-to Customer No.` re-resolves `Bill-to Contact No.`.

*Updated: 2026-04-08 -- contact lookup/validation added (PR #7525)*
