# Bulk Operations

Tests for Shopify's bulk mutation API -- the asynchronous batch processing path used for large-scale product operations. This module is separate from Products because bulk operations have their own lifecycle (staged upload, mutation submission, polling, result processing, revert) that is independent of the per-product sync logic.

## How it works

The bulk operations system works in stages: upload a JSONL file to a staged URL, submit a bulk mutation referencing that upload, then poll for completion and process results. ShpfyBulkOperationsTest covers this entire lifecycle. It tests sending a bulk mutation (which creates a "Shpfy Bulk Operation" record), sending a second after the first completes, blocking a second while the first is still running, and handling upload failures silently. The HTTP handler dispatches on a `GraphQLResponses` queue that tracks expected request types (StagedUpload, BulkMutation, CurrentOperation).

The revert tests are particularly interesting. When a bulk operation completes, the system downloads a JSONL result file to identify which individual operations succeeded. `TestBulkOperationRevertFailed` creates 4 variants with original prices, submits a bulk price update, and simulates a partial failure -- only variants 1 and 4 appear in the success result (loaded from `BulkOperationResult.txt` with ID substitution). Variants 2 and 3, which are missing from the result, get their prices reverted to the values stored in the `RequestData` JsonArray on the bulk operation record. Current coverage also verifies that legacy request data without `unitCost` still reverts price fields without touching existing unit cost, and that failed variants produce `Shpfy Skipped Record` entries pointing to the linked Item or Item Variant with the Shopify error text. `TestBulkOperationRevertAll` tests the failure path where the entire operation fails and all variants are reverted.

The send-path tests cover the diagnostic payload as well as the lifecycle. When the shop's Logging Mode is All, the JSONL sent to Shopify is stored on the bulk operation record for troubleshooting; other logging modes leave it empty. The price-update JSONL tests also lock down `compareAtPrice` semantics: clearing it sends JSON `null`, unchanged values are omitted, and positive sale compare-at prices are sent as quoted decimals.

ShpfyMockBulkProductCreate implements the `Shpfy IBulk Operation` interface for testing. It provides a productCreate mutation template with placeholder substitution for title, productType, and vendor. Its `RevertFailedRequests` and `RevertAllRequests` methods are no-ops since product creation does not need revert logic.

ShpfyBulkOperationType.EnumExt extends the production `Shpfy Bulk Operation Type` enum with an `AddProduct` test value (ID 139614) that wires to the mock implementation. ShpfyBulkOpSubscriber handles the `OnInvalidUser` event to bypass user validation during tests.

## Things to know

- The enum extension approach for injecting test bulk operation types is the same pattern used elsewhere in the connector for interface-based extensibility -- the test app adds its own enum value that maps to a mock implementation of the `Shpfy IBulk Operation` interface.
- Revert logic relies on the `RequestData` JsonArray stored on the bulk operation record, which contains the original field values (price, compareAtPrice, unitCost) for each variant. If a variant ID is not found in the Shopify result file, its values are restored from this array. Legacy blobs that predate `unitCost` are tolerated by leaving Unit Cost unchanged.
- The HTTP handler distinguishes three URL patterns: POST to the staged upload URL (UploadUrlLbl), GET for the bulk operation result file (BulkOperationUrl), and POST to the Shopify GraphQL endpoint. This three-way routing in a single handler is unique to this test area.
- `BulkOperationRunning` is a module-level boolean that controls whether the CurrentOperation response returns "RUNNING" or "COMPLETED" -- the test for blocked concurrent operations sets this to true before the second send attempt.
- ShpfyBulkOpSubscriber uses `SingleInstance = true` and `EventSubscriberInstance = Manual`, and it is bound in `ShpfyWebhooksTest`, not in `ShpfyBulkOperationsTest`. The webhook tests are the ones that drive a bulk operation callback without a real Shopify user context, so they need `OnInvalidUser` bypassed. Tests in this folder call the bulk operation code directly and do not need the binding.
- The `BulkMessageHandler` confirms the user-facing message text that appears when a bulk operation is submitted, ensuring UX consistency.
- Sent JSONL is intentionally conditional on `Shop."Logging Mode" = All`; tests assert both the stored and non-stored paths so troubleshooting support does not become the default storage behavior.
- Failed bulk price-sync rows surface through `Shpfy Skipped Record`, not just rollback. The tests link one failed Shopify variant to an Item and one to an Item Variant to ensure the user-facing skipped record points at the right BC record.
