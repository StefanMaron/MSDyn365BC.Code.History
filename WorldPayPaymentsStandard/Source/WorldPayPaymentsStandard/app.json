    "description":  "Customers continuously require higher levels of service, both in terms of the quality of product, but also in terms of delivery and payment services. WorldPay Payments Standard adds a WorldPay link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using WorldPay. You can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customer payments to arrive in your bank account. This extension can embed a link to WorldPay on all invoices automatically, or a user can do it on individual invoices. The WorldPay Payments Standard extension gives customers more ways to pay invoices because WorldPay offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, WorldPay accounts, and other sources. Plus, WorldPay delivers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on unknown websites, and WorldPay does not require monthly fees or setup fees. Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.",
